         Verify that stonith devices are configured for your OpenStack Platform HA cluster.
         We don't configure stonith device with TripleO Installer. Because the hardware
         configuration may be differ in each environment and requires different fence agents.
         How to configure fencing please read https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-openstack-platform/8/paged/director-installation-and-usage/86-fencing-the-controller-nodes
